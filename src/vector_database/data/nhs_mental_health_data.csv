But antisocial personality disorder is one of the most difficult types of personality disorders to treat.A person with antisocial personality disorder may also be reluctant to seek treatment and may only start therapy when ordered to do so by a court.The recommended treatment for someone with antisocial personality disorder will depend on their circumstances, taking into account factors such as age, offending history and whether there are any associated problems, such as alcohol or drug misuse.The person's family and friends will often play an active role in making decisions about their treatment and care.Sometimes, substance misuse services and social care may also need to be involved.National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): management and prevention of antisocial personality disorderCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is sometimes used to treat antisocial personality disorder.It's a talking therapy that aims to help a person manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave.Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT) is another type of talking therapy that's becoming more popular in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder.The therapist will encourage the person to consider the way they think and how their mental state affects their behaviour.Evidence suggests community-based programmes can be an effective long-term treatment method for people with antisocial personality disorder, and is becoming increasingly popular in prisons.DTC is a type of social therapy that aims to address the person's risk of offending, as well as their emotional and psychological needs.It's based around large and small therapy groups and focuses on community issues, creating an environment where both staff and prisoners contribute to the decisions of the community.There may also be opportunities for educational and vocational work.The recommended length of treatment is 18 months, as there needs to be enough time for a person to make changes and put new skills into practice.Self-motivation is another important factor for acceptance on to this type of scheme. For example, the person must be willing to work as part of a community, participate in groups, and be subject to the democratic process.Read more about DTC and working with offenders with personality disorder on GOV.UKThere's little evidence to support the use of medicine for treating antisocial personality disorder, but certain antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines may be helpful in some instances.Carbamazepine and lithium may help control symptoms such as aggression and impulsive behaviour, and a class of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may improve anger and general personality disorder symptoms.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder/

It's important to tell them if you're feeling particularly anxious or emotional, or are having thoughts of harming yourself.If you've not had symptoms for 6 to 12 months, you'll probably be taken off SSRIs.This will be done by slowly reducing your dose over time to help make sure your symptoms do not come back (relapse) and to avoid any side effects of coming off the drug (withdrawal symptoms), such as anxiety.Adults younger than 30 will need to be carefully monitored when taking SSRIs as they may have a higher chance of developing suicidal thoughts or trying to hurt themselves in the early stages of treatment.Children and young people may be offered an SSRI if they're having severe symptoms of BDD.Medicine should only be suggested after they have seen a psychiatrist and been offered therapy.If treatment with both CBT and an SSRI has not improved your BDD symptoms after 12 weeks, you may be prescribed a different type of SSRI or another antidepressant called clomipramine.If you do not see any improvements in your symptoms, you may be referred to a mental health clinic or hospital that specialises in BDD, such as the National OCD/BDD Service in London.These services will probably do a more in-depth assessment of your BDD.They may offer you more CBT or a different kind of therapy, as well as a different kind of antidepressant.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/body-dysmorphia/

There are lots of different types of psychotherapy, but they all involve taking time to help you get a better understanding of how you think and feel.As well as listening and discussing important issues with you, the psychotherapist can suggest ways to resolve problems and, if necessary, help you change your attitudes and behaviour. Therapy for BPD aims to help people get a better sense of control over their thoughts and feelings.Psychotherapy for BPD should only be delivered by a trained professional. They'll usually be a psychiatrist, psychologist or other trained mental health professional. Do not be afraid to ask about their experience.The type of psychotherapy you choose may be based on a combination of personal preference and the availability of specific treatments in your local area. Treatment for BPD may last a year or longer, depending on your needs and how you live your life.Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is a type of therapy specifically designed to treat people with BPD.DBT is based on the idea that 2 important factors contribute towards BPD:These 2 factors may cause you to fall into a negative cycle â€“ you experience intense and upsetting emotions, yet feel guilty and worthless for having these emotions. Because of your upbringing, you think having these emotions makes you a bad person. These thoughts then lead to further upsetting emotions. The goal of DBT is to break this cycle by introducing 2 important concepts:The DBT therapist will use both concepts to try to bring about positive changes in your behaviour.For example, the therapist could accept (validate) that feelings of intense sadness cause you to self-harm, and that behaving in such a way does not make you a terrible and worthless person.However, the therapist would then attempt to challenge the assumption that self-harming is the only way to cope with feelings of sadness.The ultimate goal of DBT is to help you ""break free"" of seeing the world, your relationships and your life in a very narrow, rigid way that leads you to engage in harmful and self-destructive behaviour.DBT usually involves weekly individual and group sessions, and you'll be given an out-of-hours contact number to call if your symptoms get worse.DBT is based on teamwork. You'll be expected to work with your therapist and the other people in your group sessions. In turn, the therapists work together as a team.DBT has proved particularly effective in treating women with BPD who have a history of self-harming and suicidal behaviour. It's been recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as the first treatment for these women to try.Visit Mind to find more information about DBT.Another type of long-term psychotherapy that can be used to treat BPD is mentalisation-based therapy (MBT).MBT is based on the concept that people with BPD have a poor capacity to mentalise.Mentalisation is the ability to think about thinking. This means examining your own thoughts and beliefs, and assessing whether they're useful, realistic and based on reality.For example, many people with BPD will have a sudden urge to self-harm and then fulfil that urge without questioning it. They lack the ability to ""step back"" from that urge and say to themselves: ""That's not a healthy way of thinking and I'm only thinking this way because I'm upset.""Another important part of mentalisation is to recognise that other people have their own thoughts, emotions, beliefs, wishes and needs, and your interpretation of other people's mental states may not necessarily be correct. In addition, you need to be aware of the potential impact your actions will have on other people's mental states.The goal of MBT is to improve your ability to recognise your own and others' mental states, learn to ""step back"" from your thoughts about yourself and others and examine them to see if they're valid.Initially, MBT may be delivered in a hospital, where you would stay as an inpatient. The treatment usually consists of daily individual sessions with a therapist and group sessions with other people with BPD.A course of MBT usually lasts around 18 months. Some hospitals and specialist centres encourage you to remain as an inpatient during this time. Other hospitals and centres may recommend that you leave the hospital after a certain period of time but remain being treated as an outpatient, where you visit the hospital regularly.Therapeutic communities (TCs) are structured environments where people with a range of complex psychological conditions and needs come together to interact and take part in therapy.TCs are designed to help people with long-standing emotional problems and a history of self-harming by teaching them skills needed to interact socially with others.Most TCs are residential, such as in large houses, where you stay for around 1 to 4 days a week.As well as taking part in individual and group therapy, you would be expected to do other activities designed to improve your social skills and self-confidence, such as:TCs are run on a democratic basis. This means that each resident and staff member has a vote on how the TC should be run, including whether a person is suitable for admission to that community.Even if your care team thinks you may benefit from spending time in a TC, it does not automatically mean the TC will allow you to join.Many TCs set guidelines on what is considered acceptable behaviour within the community, such as not drinking alcohol, no violence to other residents or staff, and no attempts at self-harming. Those who break these guidelines are usually told to leave the TC.While some people with BPD have reported that the time spent in a TC helped their symptoms, there's not yet enough evidence to tell whether TCs would help everyone with BPD.Also, because of the often strict rules on behaviour, a TC would probably not be suitable if a person were having significant difficulties controlling their behaviour.Arts or creative therapies may be offered individually or with a group as part of a treatment programme for people with BPD.Therapies may include:Arts therapies aim to help people who are finding it hard to express their thoughts and feelings verbally. The therapy focuses on creating something as a way of expressing your feelings.The courses are run by trained therapists, who can help you to think about what you've created and whether it relates to your thoughts and experiences.A course of arts therapy usually involves weekly sessions, which last up to 2 hours.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/treatment/

Other numbers may include an out-of-hours number for social workers and your local crisis resolution team (CRT).Crisis resolution teams support people with serious mental health conditions who are currently experiencing an acute and severe psychiatric crisis, which would require hospitalisation without the team's involvement. An example of a severe psychiatric crisis would be a suicide attempt.People with BPD often find that simply talking to somebody who understands their condition can help bring them out of a crisis.In a small number of cases, you may be given a short course of medicine, such as a tranquilliser, to calm your mood. This medicine is usually prescribed for 7 days.If your symptoms are particularly severe and it's thought you pose a significant risk to your own health, you may be admitted to hospital â€“ very occasionally via detention under the Mental Health Act, if you're unable to make appropriate decisions about your safety.This will be for as short a time as possible and you should be able to return home once your symptoms improve.

There are many different types of antidepressant.They have to be prescribed by a doctor, usually for depression that's moderate or severe.A GP may recommend that you take a course of antidepressants plus talking therapy, particularly if your depression is quite severe.A combination of an antidepressant and CBT usually works better than having just one of these treatments.If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a mental health team made up of psychologists, psychiatrists, specialist nurses and occupational therapists.These teams often provide intensive specialist talking treatments as well as prescribed medicine.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/depression-in-adults/treatment/

              ","Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) aims to help you understand your thoughts and behaviour, and how they affect you.CBT recognises that events in your past may have shaped you, but it concentrates mostly on how you can change the way you think, feel and behave in the present.It teaches you how to overcome negative thoughts â€“ for example, being able to challenge hopeless feelings.CBT is available on the NHS for people with depression or any other mental health problem it's been shown to help.If CBT is recommended, you'll usually have a session with a therapist once a week or once every 2 weeks. This may be a group session or an individual session.The course of treatment usually lasts for between 8 and 16 sessions, depending on how severe your condition is.Interpersonal therapy (IPT) focuses on your relationships with others and problems you may be having in your relationships, such as difficulties with communication or coping with bereavement.If it's recommended you'll usually have 8 to 16 sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is.Behavioural activation therapy focuses on identifying links between your activities and your mood, rather than focusing on thoughts and feelings. It can be useful if depression has led to you withdrawing from social activities.It helps you to make practical changes to your behaviour that may improve your mood.If it's recommended you'll usually have 12 to 16 individual sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is.Individual problem-solving is a type of therapy that focuses on identifying problems and developing plans to solve them. It's only recommended for more severe depression.If it's recommended you'll usually have 6 to 12 sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is.In psychodynamic (psychoanalytic) psychotherapy, a psychoanalytic therapist will encourage you to say whatever is going through your mind.This will help you become aware of difficult feelings in significant relationships and stressful situations, and how patterns in what you do or say may be contributing to your problems.If it's recommended you'll usually have 8 to 16 sessions with a trained practitioner, depending on how severe your condition is.Counselling is a form of therapy that helps you think about the problems you're experiencing in your life so you can find new ways of dealing with them.Counsellors support you in finding solutions to problems, but do not tell you what to do. You can talk in confidence to a counsellor, who supports you and offers practical advice.On the NHS, you may be offered 8 to 16 sessions of counselling, depending on how severe your condition is.It's ideal for people who are generally healthy but need help coping with a current crisis, such as anger, relationship issues, bereavement, redundancy, infertility or a serious illness.You may be offered behavioural couples therapy if relationship problems could be contributing to your depression, or if involving your partner could help with your treatment.If it's recommended you'll usually have 15 to 20 sessions over 5 to 6 months.See a GP for more information about accessing NHS talking therapies. They can refer you for local talking therapies for depression.You also have the option of self-referral. This means that if you prefer not to talk to a GP, you can go directly to an NHS talking therapies service.Waiting times for talking therapies can be several weeks or months. A GP can tell you how long you might need to wait, and what to do if your condition gets worse or you need support during this time.Animated video explaining self-referral to talking therapies services for stress, anxiety or depression.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/depression-in-adults/treatment/

              ","Antidepressants are medicines that treat the symptoms of depression. There are many different types available.Most people with moderate or severe depression benefit from antidepressants, but not everybody does. You may respond to 1 antidepressant but not to another, and you may need to try 2 or more treatments before you find one that works for you.The different types of antidepressant work about as well as each other. But side effects vary between different treatments and people.When you start taking antidepressants, you should see a GP or specialist nurse every week or 2 for at least 4 weeks to assess how well they're working.Contact a GP straight away if you have any feelings of hopelessness or suicidal thoughts that start or get worse after starting antidepressants.You should find that your symptoms start to improve within 4 weeks of starting antidepressants.If they're working, you'll need to continue taking them at the same dose for at least 4 to 6 months after your symptoms have eased.If you have had episodes of depression in the past, you may need to continue to take antidepressants long term. You'll be reviewed at least twice a year to see whether you need to keep taking them.Antidepressants are not addictive, but you may get some withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them suddenly or you miss a dose.If a GP thinks you'd benefit from taking an antidepressant, you'll usually be prescribed a modern type called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).Examples of commonly used SSRI antidepressants are sertraline (Lustral), paroxetine (Seroxat), fluoxetine (Prozac) and citalopram (Cipramil).They help increase the level of a natural chemical in your brain called serotonin, which is thought to be a ""good mood"" chemical.SSRIs work just as well as older antidepressants and have fewer side effects, although they can cause nausea, headaches, a dry mouth, tiredness, sleeping problems and problems having sex. But these side effects usually improve over time.SSRIs may not be prescribed for people with certain health conditions, or for children and young people under 18 years of age. Research shows that the risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviour may increase if they're taken by under-18s.Fluoxetine is the only SSRI that can be prescribed for under-18s and, even then, only when a specialist has given the go-ahead.Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are a group of antidepressants used to treat moderate to severe depression.TCAs, including imipramine (Imipramil) and amitriptyline, have been around for longer than SSRIs.They work by raising the levels of the chemicals serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain. These both help lift your mood. Side effects of TCAs vary from person to person but may include a dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, problems passing urine, sweating, feeling lightheaded and excessive drowsiness.Some of the side effects may gradually improve as your body gets used to the medicine.Antidepressants such as venlafaxine (Efexor) and duloxetine (Cymbalta or Yentreve) work in a slightly different way from SSRIs and TCAs.They're known as serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Like TCAs, they change the levels of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain.Studies have shown that an SNRI can be more effective than an SSRI, but they can lead to a rise in blood pressure.Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that increases the amount of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain.It's sometimes used together with other types of antidepressant.It can make you feel sleepy. This can be helpful if you have depression and difficulties getting to sleep.Vortioxetine (Brintellix or Lundbeck) is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for treating adults who are having a first or recurrent major depressive episode, if the current episode has not responded to 2 other antidepressants.Common side effects associated with vortioxetine include abnormal dreams, constipation, diarrhoea, dizziness, itching, nausea and vomiting.Antidepressants are not addictive in the same way that illegal drugs and cigarettes are, but you may have some withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking them.You'll be advised to reduce your dose gradually to help avoid withdrawal symptoms.These can include:In most cases, these are quite mild and last no longer than 1 or 2 weeks, but occasionally they can be quite severe.They seem to be most likely to occur with paroxetine (Seroxat) and venlafaxine (Efexor).Contact a doctor if you get withdrawal symptoms and they do not improve after 1 or 2 weeks or they get worse.Read more about stopping or coming off antidepressants.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/depression-in-adults/treatment/

It's available from health food shops and pharmacies.There's some evidence that it may help less severe depression, but it's not recommended by doctors.This is because the amount of active ingredients varies among individual brands and batches, so you can never be sure what sort of effect it'll have on you.Taking St John's wort with other medicines, such as anticonvulsants, anticoagulants, antidepressants and the contraceptive pill, can also cause serious problems.You should not take St John's wort if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, as we do not know for sure that it's safe.Also, St John's wort can interact with the contraceptive pill, reducing its effectiveness.Brain stimulation is sometimes recommended by a specialist to treat severe depression that has not responded to other treatments.Electromagnetic currents can be used to stimulate certain areas of the brain to try to improve the symptoms of depression.There are a number of different types of brain stimulation that can be used to treat depression.These include:The mental health charity Mind has more information on brain stimulation.If you have tried several different antidepressants and there's been no improvement, a specialist may offer you a medicine called lithium in addition to your current treatment.There are 2 types: lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. Both are usually effective, but if you're taking one that works for you, it's best not to change.If the level of lithium in your blood becomes too high, it can become toxic. You'll therefore need blood tests every 3 to 6 months to check your lithium levels and check for side effects while you're on the medicine.You'll also need to avoid eating a low-salt diet because this can also cause the lithium to become toxic.

              ","Fabricated or induced illness (FII) is a rare form of child abuse. It happens when a parent or carer exaggerates or deliberately causes symptoms of illness in the child.The parent or carer tries to convince doctors that the child is ill, or that their condition is worse than it really is.The parent or carer does not necessarily intend to deceive doctors, but their behaviour is likely to harm the child. For example the child may have unnecessary treatment or tests, be made to believe they're ill, or have their education disrupted.FII used to be known as ""Munchausen's syndrome by proxy"" (not to be confused with Munchausen's syndrome, where a person pretends to be ill or causes illness or injury to themselves).",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/fabricated-or-induced-illness/overview/

              ","The reasons why FII happens are not fully understood.The parent or carer will have a need for their child to be treated as if they're ill, or as being more unwell than they really are. Their behaviour is intended to convince doctors that the child is ill.This may be because the parent or carer gains something, such as attention, support or closeness to the child. Or it may be because they have anxiety or incorrect beliefs about their child's health, and they need these beliefs to be confirmed and acted upon.The parent or carer is not always fully aware of the reasons for their own behaviour.A large number of parents or carers involved in FII have borderline personality disorders characterised by emotional instability, impulsiveness and disturbed thinking.Some parents or carers involved in FII have so-called ""somatoform disorders"", where they experience multiple, recurrent physical symptoms. A proportion of these parents or carers also have Munchausen's syndrome.Some parents or carers have unresolved psychological and behavioural problems, such as a history of self-harming, or drug or alcohol misuse. Some have experienced the death of another child.There have also been several reported cases where illness was fabricated or induced for financial reasons.

If you do not know who this is, your immediate supervisor or manager should be able to tell you.If you suspect someone you know may be fabricating or inducing illness in their child, do not confront them directly.

If the child is in hospital, the parent or carer may need to be removed from the ward.The child may need help returning to a normal lifestyle, including going back to school. Younger children and babies who do not understand what was happening often make a good recovery after the abuse stops.Older children, particularly those who've been abused for many years, may have more problems. For example, many affected children believe they're really ill. They need help and support to develop a more realistic understanding of their health.It's common for older children to feel loyal to their parent or carer, and a sense of guilt if that person is removed from the family.Once the child is safe, it may be possible to treat the parent or carer's underlying psychological problems. This may include a combination of:The aim of psychotherapy is to uncover and resolve the issues that caused the person to fabricate or induce illness in the child.Family therapy aims to resolve any tensions within the family, improve parenting skills and attempt to repair the relationship between the parent or carer and the child.In more severe cases, the parent or carer may be compulsorily detained in a psychiatric ward under the Mental Health Act so their relationship with the child can be closely monitored.Parents or carers involved in FII are difficult to treat because most do not admit their deceptions and refuse to recognise their abusive behaviour.

They may be able to adjust your dose or prescribe an alternative medication.In most cases, the first medication you'll be offered will be a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).This type of medication works by increasing the level of a chemical called serotonin in your brain.Examples of SSRIs you may be prescribed include:SSRIs can be taken on a long-term basis but, as with all antidepressants, they can take several weeks to start working.You'll usually be started on a low dose, which may be gradually increased as your body adjusts to the medication.Common side effects of SSRIs include:These side effects should improve over time, although some may be related to your underlying condition.If SSRIs don't help ease your anxiety, you may be prescribed a different type of antidepressant known as a serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).This type of medication increases the amount of serotonin and noradrenaline in your brain.Examples of SNRIs you may be prescribed include:Common side effects of SNRIs include: SNRIs can also increase your blood pressure, so your blood pressure will be monitored regularly during treatment.As with SSRIs, some of the side effects (such as feeling sick, an upset stomach, problems sleeping and feeling agitated or more anxious) are more common in the first 1 or 2 weeks of treatment, but these usually settle as your body adjusts to the medication.If your medication is not helping after about 2 months of treatment or it's causing unpleasant side effects, your GP may prescribe an alternative medication.When you and your GP decide it's appropriate for you to stop taking your medication, you'll normally have your dose slowly reduced over the course of a few weeks to reduce the risk of withdrawal effects.Never stop taking your medication unless your GP specifically advises you to.If SSRIs and SNRIs aren't suitable for you, you may be offered pregabalin.This is a medication known as an anticonvulsant, which is used to treat conditions such as epilepsy, but it's also been found to be beneficial in treating anxiety.Side effects of pregabalin can include:Benzodiazepines are a type of sedative that may sometimes be used as a short-term treatment during a particularly severe period of anxiety.This is because they help ease the symptoms within 30 to 90 minutes of taking the medication.If you're prescribed a benzodiazepine, it'll usually be diazepam.Although benzodiazepines are very effective in treating the symptoms of anxiety, they can't be used for long periods.This is because they can become addictive if used for longer than 4 weeks. Benzodiazepines also start to lose their effectiveness after this time.For these reasons, you won't usually be prescribed benzodiazepines for any longer than 2 to 4 weeks at a time.Side effects of benzodiazepines can include: As drowsiness is a particularly common side effect of benzodiazepines, your ability to drive or operate machinery may be affected by taking this medication.You should avoid these activities during treatment.You should also never drink alcohol or use opiate drugs when taking benzodiazepine as doing so can be dangerous.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/generalised-anxiety-disorder/treatment/

If they do not admit to lying, most experts agree the doctor in charge of their care should minimise medical contact with them.This is because the doctor-patient relationship is based on trust and if there's evidence the patient can no longer be trusted, the doctor is unable to continue treating them.It may be possible to help control the symptoms of Munchausen syndrome if the person admits they have a problem and co-operates with treatment.There's no standard treatment for Munchausen syndrome, but a combination of psychoanalysis and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has shown some success controlling symptoms.Psychoanalysis is a type of psychotherapy that attempts to uncover and resolve unconscious beliefs and motivations.CBT helps a person identify unhelpful and unrealistic beliefs and behavioural patterns. A specially trained therapist teaches the person ways of replacing unrealistic beliefs with more realistic and balanced ones.People with Munchausen syndrome still in close contact with their family may also benefit from having family therapy.The person with the syndrome and their close family members discuss how it's affected the family and the positive changes that can be made.It can also teach family members how to avoid reinforcing the person's abnormal behaviour.

              ","Although it's not clear exactly why people develop PTSD, a number of possible reasons have been suggested.One suggestion is that the symptoms of PTSD are the result of an instinctive mechanism intended to help you survive further traumatic experiences.For example, the flashbacks many people with PTSD experience may force you to think about the event in detail so you're better prepared if it happens again.The feeling of being ""on edge"" (hyperarousal) may develop to help you react quickly in another crisis.But while these responses may be intended to help you survive, they're actually very unhelpful in reality because you cannot process and move on from the traumatic experience.Studies have shown that people with PTSD have abnormal levels of stress hormones.Normally, when in danger, the body produces stress hormones like adrenaline to trigger a reaction in the body.This reaction, often known as the ""fight or flight"" reaction, helps to deaden the senses and dull pain.People with PTSD have been found to continue to produce high amounts of fight or flight hormones even when there's no danger.It's thought this may be responsible for the numbed emotions and hyperarousal experienced by some people with PTSD.In people with PTSD, parts of the brain involved in emotional processing appear different in brain scans.One part of the brain responsible for memory and emotions is known as the hippocampus.In people with PTSD, the hippocampus appears smaller in size.It's thought that changes in this part of the brain may be related to fear and anxiety, memory problems and flashbacks.The malfunctioning hippocampus may prevent flashbacks and nightmares being properly processed, so the anxiety they generate does not reduce over time.Treatment of PTSD results in proper processing of the memories so, over time, the flashbacks and nightmares gradually disappear.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/causes/

The most common hallucination is hearing voices.Hallucinations are very real to the person experiencing them, even though people around them cannot hear the voices or experience the sensations.Research using brain-scanning equipment shows changes in the speech area in the brains of people with schizophrenia when they hear voices. These studies show the experience of hearing voices as a real one, as if the brain mistakes thoughts for real voices.Some people describe the voices they hear as friendly and pleasant, but more often they're rude, critical, abusive or annoying.The voices might describe activities taking place, discuss the hearer's thoughts and behaviour, give instructions, or talk directly to the person. Voices may come from different places or 1 place, such as the television.A delusion is a belief held with complete conviction, even though it's based on a mistaken, strange or unrealistic view. It may affect the way the person behaves. Delusions can begin suddenly or may develop over weeks or months.Some people develop a delusional idea to explain a hallucination they're having. For example, if they have heard voices describing their actions, they may have a delusion that someone is monitoring their actions.Someone experiencing a paranoid delusion may believe they're being harassed or persecuted. They may believe they're being chased, followed, watched, plotted against or poisoned, often by a family member or friend.Some people who experience delusions find different meanings in everyday events or occurrences.They may believeâ€¯people on TV or in newspaper articles are communicating messages to them alone, or that there are hidden messages in the colours of cars passing on the street.People experiencing psychosis often have trouble keeping track of their thoughts and conversations.Some people find it hard to concentrate and will drift from one idea to another. They may have trouble reading newspaper articles or watching a TV programme.People sometimes describe their thoughts as ""misty"" or ""hazy"" when this is happening to them. Thoughts and speech may become jumbled or confused, making conversation difficult and hard for other people to understand.Some people describe their thoughts as being controlled by someone else, that their thoughts are not their own, or that thoughts have been planted in their mind by someone else.Another feeling is that thoughts are disappearing, as though someone is removing them from their mind.Some people feel their body is being taken over and someone else is directing their movements and actions.These feelings of confusion may lead to a person's behaviour becoming more disorganised and unpredictable.The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often appear several months or years before somebody experiences their first acute schizophrenic episode with symptoms such as delusions or hallucinationsThese initial negative symptoms are often referred to as the prodromal period of schizophrenia.Symptoms during the prodromal period usually appear gradually and slowly get worse.It can be difficult to tell if these are symptoms of schizophrenia or something else .Negative symptoms experienced by people living with schizophrenia can include:The negative symptoms of schizophrenia can often lead to relationship problems with friends and family as they can sometimes be mistaken for deliberate laziness or rudeness.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms/

              ","Schizophrenia is often described by doctors as a type of psychosis.A first acute episode of psychosis can be very difficult to cope with, both for the person who is ill and for their family and friends.Drastic changes in behaviour may occur, and the person can become upset, anxious, confused, angry or suspicious of those around them. But most people who get psychotic episodes are not a danger to others.They may not think they need help, and it can be hard to persuade them to visit a doctor.The Mind website has more information about psychosis.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/schizophrenia/symptoms/

              ","Schizophrenia tends to run in families, but no single gene is thought to be responsible.It's more likely that different combinations of genes make people more vulnerable to the condition. However, having these genes does not necessarily mean you'll develop schizophrenia.Evidence that the disorder is partly inherited comes from studies of twins. Identical twins share the same genes.In identical twins, if a twin develops schizophrenia, the other twin has a 1 in 2 chance of developing it, too. This is true even if they're raised separately. In non-identical twins, who have different genetic make-ups, when a twin develops schizophrenia, the other only has a 1 in 8 chance of developing the condition.While this is higher than in the general population, where the chance is about 1 in 100, it suggests genes are not the only factor influencing the development of schizophrenia.Studies of people with schizophrenia have shown there are subtle differences in the structure of their brains.These changes are not seen in everyone with schizophrenia and can occur in people who do not have a mental illness. But they suggest schizophrenia may partly be a disorder of the brain.Neurotransmitters are chemicals that carry messages between brain cells.It is thought people with schizophrenia may have different amounts of certain neurotransmitters in their brains.Medicines that help lower the amounts of certain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, can help with the symptoms of schizophrenia in some people.This suggests neurotransmitters play a role in the development of schizophrenia.Research has shown people who develop schizophrenia are more likely to have experienced complications before and during their birth, such as:It may be that these things have a subtle effect on brain development.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/schizophrenia/causes/

During an acute episode the symptoms of psychosis, where a person is unable to tell the difference between reality and their imagination, can become overwhelming.During this time, a person may require a more intensive level of care than a CMHT can provide, to help keep them safe from harm.A treatment option is to contact a home treatment or crisis resolution team (CRT).CRTs care for people with serious mental health conditions who are currently experiencing an acute and severe psychiatric episode, sometimes called a 'crisis'.The aim of a CRT is to support people without having to admit them to a hospital (but they can arrange admission if needed).The CRT aims to treat people in the least restrictive environment possible, ideally in or near their home. This can be in your own home, in a dedicated crisis residential home or hostel, or in a day care centre.CRTs are also responsible for planning aftercare once the crisis has passed to prevent a further crisis occurring.Your care co-ordinator should be able to provide you and your friends or family with contact information in the event of a crisis.People who are undergoing a very severe schizophrenia episode may require in-patient care at a hospital or psychiatric clinic.If a personâ€™s care team think they would be best cared for in a hospital or clinic, they will explain that to the person and encourage them to admit themselves for care.There may be times when a person refuses to go into hospital but the clinic feels that they do not have the mental capacity to make an informed decision about their own care.

              ","Antipsychotics are usually recommended as the initial treatment for the symptoms of an acute schizophrenic episode. They work by blocking the effect of the chemical dopamine, or other chemicals on the brain.Antipsychotics can usually reduce feelings of anxiety or aggression within a few hours of use, but may take several days or weeks to reduce other symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusional thoughts.Your doctor may recommend a physical examination, and possibly some scans, such as an ECG. It's important that your doctor gives you a thorough physical examination before you start taking antipsychotics, and that you work together to find the right one for you.Antipsychotics can be taken orally as a pill, or be given as an injection known as a depot. Several slow-release antipsychotics are available. These require you to have one injection every 1 to 4 weeks. You will usually be given the lowest dose possible that it thought able to effectively control symptoms.You may only need antipsychotics until your acute schizophrenic episode has passed.However, most people take medication for 1 or 2 years after their first psychotic episode to prevent further acute schizophrenic episodes occurring, and for longer if the illness is recurrent.There are 2 main types of antipsychotics:The choice of antipsychotic should be made following a discussion between you and your psychiatrist about the likely benefits and side effects.Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause side effects, although not everyone will experience them and the severity will differ from person to person.The side effects of typical antipsychotics include:Side effects of both typical and atypical antipsychotics include:Antipsychotics can also cause side effects which may need to be monitored while you are taking them.

              ","Some people with SAD find that light therapy can help improve their mood considerably. This involves sitting by a special lamp called a light box, usually for around 30 minutes to an hour each morning.Light boxes come in a variety of designs, including desk lamps and wall-mounted fixtures. They produce a very bright light. The intensity of the light is measured in lux â€“ the higher lux, the brighter the light.The light produced by the light box simulates the sunlight that's missing during the darker winter months.It's thought the light may improve SAD by encouraging your brain to reduce the production of melatonin (a hormone that makes you sleepy) and increase the production of serotonin (a hormone that affects your mood).Sunrise alarm clocks, which gradually light up your bedroom as you wake up, may also be useful for some people.Most people can use light therapy safely. The recommended light boxes have filters that remove harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays, so there's no risk of skin or eye damage for most people.However, exposure to very bright light may not be suitable if you:Speak to a GP if you're unsure about the suitability of a particular product.Light boxes are not usually available on the NHS, so you'll need to buy one yourself if you want to try light therapy.Before using a light box, you should check the manufacturer's information and instructions regarding:Make sure that you choose a light box that is medically approved for the treatment of SAD and produced by a fully certified manufacturer.There's mixed evidence regarding the overall effectiveness of light therapy, but some studies have concluded it's effective, particularly if used first thing in the morning.

505,Selective mutism,"Selective mutism is an anxiety disorder where a person is unable to speak in certain social situations, such as with classmates at school or to relatives they do not see very often.It usually starts during childhood and, if left untreated, can persist into adulthood.A child or adult with selective mutism does not refuse or choose not to speak at certain times, they're literally unable to speak. The expectation to talk to certain people triggers a freeze response with feelings of anxiety and panic, and talking is impossible.In time, the person may learn to anticipate the situations that provoke this distressing reaction and do all they can to avoid them.However, people with selective mutism are able to speak freely to certain people, such as close family and friends, when nobody else is around to trigger the freeze response. Selective mutism affects about 1 in 140 young children. It's more common in girls and children who have recently migrated from their country of birth.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/selective-mutism/
506,Selective mutism,"Selective mutism can start at any age, but most often starts in early childhood, between age 2 and 4. It's often first noticed when the child starts to interact with people outside their family, such as when they begin nursery or school.The main warning sign is the marked contrast in the child's ability to engage with different people, characterised by a sudden stillness and frozen facial expression when they're expected to talk to someone who's outside their comfort zone.They may avoid eye contact and appear:More confident children with selective mutism can use gestures to communicate â€“ for example, they may nod for ""yes"" or shake their head for ""no"".But more severely affected children tend to avoid any form of communication â€“ spoken, written or gestured.Some children may manage to respond with a few words, or they may speak in an altered voice, such as a whisper.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/selective-mutism/
507,Selective mutism,"Experts regard selective mutism as a fear (phobia) of talking to certain people. The cause is not always clear, but it's known to be associated with anxiety.The child will usually have a tendency to anxiety and have difficulty taking everyday events in their stride.Find out more about anxiety in children.Many children become too distressed to speak when separated from their parents and transfer this anxiety to the adults who try to settle them.If they have a speech and language disorder or hearing problem, it can make speaking even more stressful.Some children have trouble processing sensory information such as loud noise and jostling from crowds â€“ a condition known as sensory integration dysfunction.This can make them ""shut down"" and be unable to speak when overwhelmed in a busy environment. Again, their anxiety can transfer to other people in that environment.When mutism occurs as a symptom of post-traumatic stress, it follows a very different pattern and the child suddenly stops talking in environments where they previously had no difficulty.Another misconception is that a child with selective mutism is controlling or manipulative, or has autism. There's no relationship between selective mutism and autism, although a child may have both.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/selective-mutism/
508,Selective mutism,"Left untreated, selective mutism can lead to isolation, low self-esteem and social anxiety disorder. It can continue into adolescence and adulthood if not managed.A child can successfully overcome selective mutism if it's diagnosed at an early age and appropriately managed. It's important for selective mutism to be recognised early by families and schools so they can work together to reduce a child's anxiety. Staff in early years settings and schools may receive training so they're able to provide appropriate support.If you suspect your child has selective mutism and help is not available, or there are additional concerns â€“ for example, the child struggles to understand instructions or follow routines â€“ speak to a GP and ask them to refer you to a local specialist service for a formal diagnosis.You can also contact a speech and language therapy clinic directly. Do not accept the opinion that your child will grow out of it or they are ""just shy"".Your GP or local integrated care board (ICB) should be able to give you the telephone number of your nearest NHS speech and language therapy service or another specialist service that can help in your area.Your child may also need to see a mental health professional or school educational psychologist. The clinician may initially want to talk to you without your child present, so you can speak freely about any anxieties you have about your child's development or behaviour.They'll want to find out whether there's a history of anxiety disorders in the family, and whether anything is causing distress, such as a disrupted routine or difficulty learning a second language. They'll also look at behavioural characteristics and take a full medical history.A person with selective mutism may not be able to speak during their assessment, but the clinician should be prepared for this and be willing to find another way to communicate.For example, they may encourage a child with selective mutism to communicate through their parents, or suggest that older children or adults write down their responses or use a computer. They may watch the child playing or watch a video of them speaking in a comfortable environment.It's possible for adults to overcome selective mutism, although they may continue to experience the psychological and practical effects of spending years without social interaction or not being able to reach their academic or occupational potential.Adults will ideally be seen by a mental health professional with access to support from a speech and language therapist or another knowledgeable professional.Selective mutism is diagnosed according to specific guidelines. These include observations about the person concerned as outlined:",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/selective-mutism/
509,Selective mutism,"A child with selective mutism will often have other fears and social anxieties, and they may also have additional speech and language difficulties.They're often wary of doing anything that draws attention to them because they think that by doing so, people will expect them to talk.For example, a child may not do their best in class after seeing other children being asked to read out good work, or they may be afraid to change their routine in case this provokes comments or questions. Many have a general fear of making mistakes.Accidents and urinary infections may result from being unable to ask to use the toilet and holding on for hours at a time. School-aged children may avoid eating and drinking throughout the day so they do not need to excuse themselves.Children may have difficulty with homework assignments or certain topics because they're unable to ask questions in class.Teenagers may not develop independence because they're afraid to leave the house unaccompanied. And adults may lack qualifications because they're unable to participate in college life or subsequent interviews.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/selective-mutism/
510,Selective mutism,"With appropriate handling and treatment, most children are able to overcome selective mutism. But the older they are when the condition is diagnosed, the longer it will take.The effectiveness of treatment will depend on:Treatment does not focus on the speaking itself, but reducing the anxiety associated with speaking.This starts by removing pressure on the person to speak. They should then gradually progress from relaxing in their school, nursery or social setting, to saying single words and sentences to one person, before eventually being able to speak freely to all people in all settings. The need for individual treatment can be avoided if family and staff in early years settings work together to reduce the child's anxiety by creating a positive environment for them.This means:As well as these environmental changes, older children may need individual support to overcome their anxiety.Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) helps a person focus on how they think about themselves, the world and other people, and how their perception of these things affects their thoughts and feelings. CBT also challenges fears and preconceptions through graded exposure.Behavioural therapy concentrates on helping combat current difficulties using a gradual step-by-step approach to help conquer fears.There are several techniques based on CBT and behavioural therapy that are useful in treating selective mutism. These can be used at the same time by individuals, family members and school or college staff, possibly under the guidance of a speech and language therapist or psychologist.In graded exposure, situations causing the least anxiety are tackled first. With realistic targets and repeated exposure, the anxiety associated with these situations decreases to a manageable level.Older children and adults are encouraged to work out how much anxiety different situations cause, such as answering the phone or asking a stranger the time.In stimulus fading, the person with selective mutism communicates at ease with someone, such as their parent, when nobody else is present.Another person is gradually introduced into the situation and, once they're included in talking, the parent withdraws. The new person can introduce more people in the same way.Shaping involves using any technique that enables the person to gradually produce a response that's closer to the desired behaviour.For example, starting with non-verbal communication, gradually moving to making eye contact, saying short words and then longer sentences and, finally, 2-way conversation.Positive and negative reinforcement involves responding favourably to all forms of communication and not inadvertently encouraging avoidance and silence.If the child is under pressure to talk, they'll experience great relief when the moment passes, which will strengthen their belief that talking is a negative experience.Desensitisation is a technique that involves reducing the person's sensitivity to other people hearing their voice by sharing voice or video recordings.For example, email or instant messaging could progress to an exchange of voice recordings or voicemail messages, then more direct communication, such as telephone or Skype conversations.You could also record your child at home and encourage them to watch or listen to themselves speaking.Medicine is only really appropriate for older children, teenagers and adults whose anxiety has led to depression and other problems.Medicine should never be prescribed as an alternative to environmental changes and behavioural approaches. Though some health professionals recommend using a combination of medicine and behavioural therapies in adults with selective mutism.However, antidepressants may be used alongside a treatment programme to decrease anxiety levels, particularly if previous attempts to engage the individual in treatment have failed.",https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/selective-mutism/
